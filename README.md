# Team Showcase - Ball Pit

This is a Project to have a Team Showcase animated like a Ball Pit. 
The design Idea came from a Word Cloud on Mentimeter.com.

The BaseCode comes from https://codepen.io/Alca/pen/gGPzYr.

## Modifications

### TODO:
- Magnetic Pit Shape
- Circle to pictures
- Slow pop up large -> move to Pit small
- Automatic generation amount of Items in Folder
- Pit slowly growing

    '''var im = new Image();
    im.src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Face-smile.svg";
    ctx.drawImage(im, 0, 0);'''
