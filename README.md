# Team Showcase - Ball Pit

This is a Project to have a Team Showcase animated like a Ball Pit. 
The design Idea came from a Word Cloud on Mentimeter.com.

The BaseCode comes from https://codepen.io/Alca/pen/gGPzYr.

## Modifications

### TODO:
- Magnetic Pit Shape
- Circle to pictures
- Slow pop up large -> move to Pit small
- Automatic generation amount of Items in Folder
- Pit slowly growing
- Fade over to Logo at the End (Movie aftereffects?)


#### Replace color with Image
currently pictures are fixed in the Background and not moving with the ball
